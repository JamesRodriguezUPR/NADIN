# NADIN

This is the repo for UPRM's research project on detecting network attacks, specifically sinkhole and wormhole, on RPL WSN.

## Coding Guidelines

We will be using a styling guide for all of our code. This makes code easier to read and maintain.


## C++ projec structure

```
bin/
build/
doc/
include/
libs/
src/
test/
Makefile
```
bin - diirectory where the executables go. Must excluded with gitignore.
build - intermediary folder to compile the code. Must be excluded with gitignore.
doc - folder for the documentation of the code.
include - where our header files go.
libs - used to house third party libraries.
src - where our code goes
Makefile - file to automate ocmpilation with cmake.
